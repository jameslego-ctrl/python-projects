This is a simple tcp server and tcp client ; Here multiple clients can chat with each other using the server

# [+] steps

[*] The first step is to configure the server.py file , change the "host = '127.0.0.1' " to the ipv4 of the machine running the server
[*] configure the tcpclient.py file : change the ip of the "client.connect()" to the server ip

[*] Now open up a terminal 
[*] run the server.py file "python3 server.py"
[*] run the tcpclient.py as same way in a diff machine or a terminal 

[*] Now hopefully you are good to go


# [+]  Notes

[|] many clients can connect its multi-client system and chat to each other
[|] remember you need to put the same ip and port as the server.py in tcpclient.py
